Bozon-Verduraz, Jean
France

   Jean Bozon-Verduraz was born in Saint-Etienne-de-Cuines (Savoie) on 29 May 1889. He entered military service in October 1910 and served with the Dragoons until his release from active service. When hostilities broke out he was recalled and served with the Hussars until his transfer to the Aviation Service and his arrival at Crotoy to begin pilot training 8 October 1915.
  Bozon-Verduraz was assigned to Esc C11 on 10 March 1916, where he served until he was selected for fighter school. On 15 June 1917 he was assigned to Esc N3 - Les Cigognes. On the morning of 11 September 1917 Georges Guynemer took off in company with Lieutenant Bozon-Verduraz to patrol the area around Langemark.  About 09:30 hours while at 4,000 metres over Poelkapelle, Guynemer spotted a German biplane and dove to attack. As he was doing so eight German Albatros fighters arrived on the scene and made to intercept the Frenchmen. Realising that they were outnumbered, Bozon-Verduraz broke off and thought his squadron commander had as well. He returned to base where he found no sign of Guynemer. 
  Bozon-Verduraz gained eight victories with the Storks, and was given command of Spa94 on 1 July 1918. He ended the war with eleven confirmed vicories.
Jean Bozon-Verduraz died on 21 June 1942.
