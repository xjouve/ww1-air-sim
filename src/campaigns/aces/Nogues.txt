Nogues, Marcel
France

   Marcel Joseph Marie Nogues was born on 24 January 1895 in Paris. War broke out, and he enlisted on 4 September 1914, assigned to 6ème Régiment d'Artillerie Coloniale, then transferred to the 107ème Régiment d'Artillerie Lourde. He requested pilot training and was detached to the Aéronautique Militaire on 24 January 1916, his twenty-first birthday.
  He received a Pilot's Brevet on May 20, 1916, and after additional training at Dijon, Ambrieu, Avord, Cazaux and Pau, he was assigned to Escadrille N12 on September 26, 1916. He claimed his first victory on 4 March 1917, and his second on April 12 but was captured the next day when he was shot down by Albert Dossenbach of Jasta 36. He managed a hasty escape and rejoined N12 some time after.
  On 13 August 1917 Nogues was badly wounded by shrapnel and spent months in hospital. After recovering from his wounds, he joined Spa57 on 11 April 1918 and downed six German aircraft and five balloons. He was made a Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur and was awarded the Croix de Guerre avec 10 Palmes and the Médaille Militaire. Shortly before the Armistice he was reassigned to Spa172 but claimed no further victories.
   "Marcel Joseph Marie Nogues, who has just been demobilised after serving at the front for the last five years in an Escadrille de Chasse, was killed on Sunday, 5 October when playing Rugby football. In the course of a friendly match between Trie Racing Club and the Paris University Fifteen, Nogues, who was playing for the former, sustained injuries to his larynx and died during the evening. He was aged 24."
