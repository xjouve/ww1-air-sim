To Install CfsTmap.

Unzip the archive to your chosen destination. A folder "CfsTmap" will
be created there containing the Program and all the support files.

If you do not have mwgfx.dll installed on your system then browse to
the CfsTmap folder and run the mwgfxdll.exe program - this will
install the dll to C:\Windows\System\. If your Windows folder is named
differently then edit the destination when prompted.
