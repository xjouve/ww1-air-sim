Dummy help file for LibView.exe

  LibView.EXE

LibView is a little tool to look into the Object Library files of
FS98 and CFS and of course compatible files.

The standard files are: DYNLIB.BGL     for FS98 and
                        LIBRARY.BGL    for CFS.

The purpose of this program is to show you the object ID's of the
objects so you can do some experiments with them. Just use the cryptic
hex numbers in the SCASM codes CallLibObj (FS98) or CallLibObj2 (CFS).

The format for both libraries is different. In CFS libraries the
objects also have an object discribtion.

Select "catalogue" to see this data.

The "View" option is not fully implemented in the public version of
LibView. It will only show you the object code as a hex dump. To
make this option fully functional you need to install the BGL
decompiler BLIST in the same directory as LibView.
Note: there is no SAVE function in this program, but the BLIST output
is stored in the file LIBVIEW.TMP in LibView's home directory.
