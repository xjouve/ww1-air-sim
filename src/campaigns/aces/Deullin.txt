Deullin, Albert
France                                                                                                           Born on 24 August 1890 in Epernay, Albert Louis Deullin enlisted at an early age in 1906 in the French military. Before the war he was established a reputation for himself as a scholar, studying in Germany and England.  When war broke out Duellin rejoined his Dragoons Regiment, and spent the winter of 1914-15 in the trenches. One such winter proved enough, and he transferred to the Flying Service in April, 1915 receiving his pilot's brevet June 14. 
  Deullin was assigned to MF62 on 2 July 1915, flying Maurice Farmans on artillery spotting and photo missions.  His work was good enough to earn him a citation and a transfer in March 1916 to a fighter unit--the famous Escadrille N.3 of the Cigognes Group. An arm wound kept him on the ground for a time, but by May he was back with his squadron and on June 4, 1916 he received the Legion d'Honneur in recognition of his 4th victory.
  Deullin rose steadily in the ace rankings, and after his 11th victory he was given command of Escadrille N73 on February 22, 1917.  He fought in all the major air battles for the rest of the war, assuming command of Groupe de Combat 19 and claiming 20 confirmed victories at wars end.  
  Albert Deullin was killed on 29 May 1923 while testing an aeroplane prototype at Villacoublay. He was 32.
