CfsTmap Update text

4.00.9 ======= 27/02/00 ==================================

Texture drawing method changed after Jan ter Horst reported
that there were problems during Quick Combat over the Demo
Arran scenery. The Aircraft names were flickering and
disappearing and sometimes the Aircraft too! The changes 
also make unnecessary the need for Level mesh for placing
static scenery (though it is still a good idea) 

4.00.8 ======= 25/02/00 ==================================

Various tweaks and tidyups to get ready for release. 
Modified "Adjoining Layouts" so that they are assumed to
be in the same folder as the current layout - useful if
you move folders about or send them to other people.
Distribution version will come with Scasm 2.39 included
with permission of Manfred Moldenhauer. Users of previous
beta versions of CfsTmap will need to use the Prefs menu
to select this scasm which is in the same folder as CfsTmap.
New users will have this one selected automatically.

4.00.7 ======= 11/02/00 ==================================

Changed name to CfsTMap (from CfsTrn)

Major addition - Allow the selecting of "Adjoining Layouts"
                 Other mtw files can be selected as located
                 next to the current layout (NSE & W) and
                 the appropriate edge-textures of these
                 layouts will be used during the matching
                 process so layouts will join together
                 smoothly.

4.00.6 ======= 06/02/00 ==================================

Solved several Elevation-related problems.

Major addition - Elevation Interpolation.... If this option
                 is selected in the Prefs menu then the
                 output will use 16 elevation points for
                 each tile. The 4 corner ones are the ones
                 set in the layout but 5 extra points are
                 calculated. These points will be lower
                 by a standard amount around the edges 
                 (so tiles will still mesh at any rotation) 
                 but by a random amount for the middle 1.
                 The amount is not much but it helps in
                 breaking up the Angularity!

              -  Functions to Import the Elevations for
                 any edge from another file (presumably
                 the layout that meets on that edge)

4.00.5 ======= 05/02/00 ==================================

Changes to the way the rescaled elevation is calculated
Base Altitude multiplied by scale.
Shift Layout and Shift Tiles now also copies rotation.

4.00.3 ======= 02/02/00 ==================================

Of course I was wrong in thinking that the Elevation points
won`t be rotated. They will! This means that they need to
be contrarotated by the same amount as the bitmap is being
rotated.....

4.00.2 ======= 02/02/00 ==================================

This is the first real beta. Currently terrain is generated 
using TexRelief. TexRelief gives the opportunity to utilise 
rotation for images

Features :-

Rotatable Images - All images are rotatable 0, 90, 180, 270
                   either from the selection thumbnail or
                   in the actual displayed tile - as the 
                   mouse moves over a tile a button will 
                   appear in the corner. Each click on this
                   will rotate 90 deg.

                   If "Rotation" is checked in the Prefs menu
                   then all possible variations of all std
                   bitmaps will be used in the matching process

                   note that no new images are created. Rotation
                   is done within the Program on the fly.

Scaled Elevation - Elevations are now calculated with scale
                   compensation so an elevation of 100m will give
                   100m (not 400m at scale 4, 300m at scale 3 etc)
