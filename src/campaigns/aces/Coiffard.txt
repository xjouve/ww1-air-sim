Coiffard, Michel
France

	Michel Joseph Callixte Marie Coiffard was born July 16, 1892 in Nantes, Brittany. He joined the French army in 1910, serving with the artillery in Tunisia and in Morocco. He was wounded several times, received several decorations and a promotion to Brigadier. On June 5, 1915 he was wounded for the fourth time and requested transfer to the elite Chasseurs Alpins.  On August 19, 1916, Coiffard was struck by a bullet in the forearm and later received shrapnel in the stomach, rendering him unfit for further duty. He was invalided out of the infantry, and after convalescence, entered the Air Service 4 January 1917. 
  Coiffard received his Pilot's Brevet on April 19, 1917, and was transferred to N154 on 28 June 1917 .   He soon became another of the great French balloon-busters. While the life expectancy of any First World War aviator was short, specialising in downing enemy balloons was an especially dangerous occupation, protected as they were by artillery and patrolling aircraft. Nevertheless Coiffard excelled in his chosen field.  Of his final total of 34 confirmed air victories fully 28 were achieved against German balloons.
  On October 28th, 1918, Coiffard was flying an escort mission when he was severely wounded in the air.  He managed to bring his SPAD down safely, but died in an ambulance a few hours later.
