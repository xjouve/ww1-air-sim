Madon, Felix
France

   Felix Madon was born July 28 1892, in Bizerte, Tunisia. While in Paris attending school, he fell in love with aviation and received his civil pilot's licence 7 June 1911.  He volunteered for military service in March 1912 and transferred to the Air Service at Avord 1 January 1913 where he earned his Brevet. 
  When war broke out Madon was assigned to BL30 flying reconnaisance and night bombing missions.
Incredibly, Madon flew through all four years of World War I despite several hair-raising brushes with death. In October of 1914, an artillery shell blew the engine off his airplane, but Madon was able to bring the stricken craft safely to earth. On April 5, 1915, familiarizing himself with a new aircraft type, he accidentally landed in Switzerland, where he was interned. He and his observer escaped, only to be confined for sixty days by the French Army as punishment for getting himself interned!  
  On his return, Madon was assigned to MF218, but he soon requested training as a pilote de chasse and on 1 September 1916 was transferred to Esc N.38. He assumed command of Spa 38 March 24 1918. Promoted to Capitaine on the last day of the war, he had 41 confirmed kills to his credit. Unofficially, Madon was credited with 64 probable victories, for a theoretical total of 105! He ranks among the least recognized top aces of the Great War. 
  Felix Madon met his death on 11 November 1924 - the sixth anniversary of the end of the First World War - while flying in tribute to the (deceased) French aviation legend Roland Garros. His aircraft malfunctioned  and he deliberately crashed  into the roof of a villa rather than hit watching spectators.  He was 32.
