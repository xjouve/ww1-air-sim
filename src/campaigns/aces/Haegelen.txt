Haegelen, Claude
France

   Claude Marcel Haegelen was born 13 September 1896 at Belfort near the Swiss border. By the time the war erupted he was in the automobile business in Dijon. He volunteered for service 15 September 1914, enlisting in an infantry regiment.  While recovering from a bout of typhoid fever Haegelen applied for pilot training,  reported to 1er Groupe d'Aviation at Dijon on 27 May 1915, and received his Brevet 10 January 1916.
  Haegelen was assigned to Esc F8 on 10 April 1916. Like many others who would later become fighter pilots Haegelen first had to serve his apprenticeship in observation craft.  He was shot down three times while on reconnaissance missions, but always returned to fly again, sometimes on the same day!  For this kind of dedication Haegelen was sent to GDE 8 February 1917 where he received further training and rewarded with an assignment to Esc N.3, Les Cigognes.  He scored his first victory on May 27, 1917.  The following day he scored again, but was severely wounded, and spent a long time in hospital. He joined Spa.100 on 11 March 1918, and by the end of the war had 23 victories, including 12 balloons. 
  Haegelen stayed in aviation after the war, becoming chief test pilot for Hanriot and a noted aerobatic pilot, and was also active in veterans and reserve organizations. During the Second World War he was a member of the Resistance. He was made a Grand Officier of the Legion of Honour, with the rank of Colonel.  Claude Haegelen died June 1, 1950 at Val de Grace.
