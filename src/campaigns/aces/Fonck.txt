Fonck, René
France

René Paul Fonck, distinguished as the paramount Allied ace of the conflict, was ushered into existence on the 27th of March, 1894, in the humble environs of Saulcy-sur-Meurthe, nestled within the Vosges, born to a family of modest means. His progenitor, a sagard—a laborer tasked with the transmutation of timber into planks within the sawmills of the Vosges—departed from this mortal coil when young René was but four years of age. The progeny was subsequently entrusted to the care of an uncle in Nancy, who placed him within the austere confines of a religious boarding school in the city. This institution, renowned for its Spartan discipline, would be his abode until 1904, whence he returned to the maternal hearth and promptly commenced his foray into the working world as an apprentice mechanic. Characterized by an inherent shyness and hampered by a stutter, an affliction that would persist into his later years, Fonck exhibited a profound fascination with the realm of aviation—a pursuit seemingly unattainable for one of his social standing, despite his zealous interest.

Conscripted into the armed forces on the 22nd of August, 1914, at Dijon, Fonck was initially dispatched to the 11th Régiment du Génie for his foundational military instruction—a period extending over five arduous months, throughout which he harbored an eager anticipation for the opportunity to take to the skies. Subsequently, he embarked upon an 18-day theoretical course in Saint-Cyr and Lyon, culminating in his flight training in April, whereupon he achieved certification and was assigned to Esc C.47. It was within this cadre that he would claim his inaugural victories and earn numerous commendations, piloting the Caudron G4.

The narrative of Fonck's career is further embellished on the 25th of April, 1917, with his transfer to the legendary 'Storks' escadrilles of GC12, Spa 103, where he piloted the SPAD S.VII. The advent of the SPAD S.XIII's ultimate variant in May heralded a period during which Fonck would amass the majority of his victories, swiftly attaining ace status. By the autumn of 1917, he had vanquished 18 German aircraft and was inducted into the Legion of Honor.

Fonck's tenure as a combat aviator was marked by numerous instances of multiple victories, notably achieving the downing of six adversaries in a single day on two separate occasions, and astonishingly, three enemy aircraft within a mere ten seconds. The French Ace Boyau, in an expression of unparalleled admiration, proclaimed to a journalist, "Fonck transcends all conceivable bounds. He is not merely a man; he is akin to a raptor. In the firmament, he possesses an uncanny ability to sense the enemy, discerning them from distances of 8 or 10 kilometers, unseen. Selecting his quarry with precision, a mere handful of bullets suffice, leaving the enemy without recourse."

Official records attribute 75 confirmed victories to Fonck, out of 107 claims. Additionally, Fonck's own enumerations suggest 20+ further engagements, likely indicative of collaborative victories achieved in concert with Spa 103 or the affiliated stork squadron Spa 26, potentially in the capacity of patrol leader. Indeed, military annals frequently corroborate such shared triumphs among the aviators of Spa 103 or Spa 26.

Post-conflict, Fonck transitioned into the realms of politics and entrepreneurship, securing a seat in Parliament and establishing ownership over an automotive enterprise. His aviation pursuits persisted, culminating in his appointment as President of the Ligue Aéronautique Française (the French Aeronautical Society), thereby maintaining his prominence within the public eye. In 1924, he penned "L'Aviation et la Sécurité Française," a tome offering insightful post-war geopolitical analysis, cautioning of Germany's unabated ambition, the fierce competition from America, England, and Japan, Italy's ascent, and the looming specter of a Russian resurgence under a new Genghis Khan—a harbinger of judgment for the civilized world.

Between 1925 and 1926, Fonck's collaboration with the Russian-American engineer Sikorsky in an audacious attempt to traverse the Atlantic by air, though marred by tragedy during takeoff, underscored the fragile nature of his perceived invincibility. This endeavor, coupled with political rivalries, eroded his erstwhile untouchable status.

With the descent of France in the Second World War, Fonck's allegiance to Marshal Pétain—revered among veterans as the 'victor of Verdun' and a proponent of aviation—was manifest. He counseled Pétain on the potential perils of the impending Montoire meeting with Hitler, leveraging intelligence from the Japanese ambassador. By 1942, Fonck had relocated to Paris, though the details of his activities during this period largely remain enshrouded in mystery. Known to have maintained close ties with his former comrade and illustrious ace of the Storks, Heurteau, who spearheaded the resistance network 'Réseau Hector', Fonck frequented a bar where he often engaged with pilots and members of the resistance, including Codos, Sadi-Lacointe, and Sautereau, the latter being the leader of 'Réseau Rafale'. In the tide of June 1944, the German occupiers came to regard Fonck with suspicion, leading to his eventual arrest and internment in the Drancy camp, under allegations of aiding a Jewish family.

The aftermath of World War II prompted an investigation into Fonck's affiliations with the Vichy government, a scrutiny applied universally to those entangled in the regime's complexities. Nevertheless, no charges were levied against him. Contrary to the inertia of his own efforts to document his resistance activities, Fonck was posthumously recognized with a Certificate of Resistance by Sautereau in 1947, a testament to the unspoken valor he exhibited against the occupation forces. The Vosges Who's Who later recorded, "He directed all his efforts, while remaining in France, by a relentless struggle and by the means at his disposal, against the Occupation. History will tell later the important services rendered to the country during this painful period."

Subsequent testimonies have painted a portrait of Fonck leveraging his extensive network to aid the resistance movement: facilitating Codos' release from Gestapo captivity, seeking clemency for 33 resistance fighters who assailed the German police station in Saint-Dié, securing a reprieve for Méline, a prominent resistance leader in the Remiremont region, sparing Vaucourt, the mayor of Saulcy-sur-Meurthe, from execution after his capture aiding escapees, and employing Panin, a key figure in the Vosges resistance, to alert Jewish families of impending danger.

Upon the occasion of Fonck's passing on June 18, 1953, in Paris, consequent to an aneurysm rupture, the French media's response was notably subdued, presenting a marked disparity when juxtaposed with the more pronounced recognition from American journalism. Time magazine, in particular, illuminated his re-engagement with military duties in 1939 and recounted a rather fantastical narrative of his covert operations in 1942, wherein he purportedly masqueraded as a Trappist monk to aid in the orchestration of a network in Belgium dedicated to the extrication of Allied aviators. This account, while captivating, is ensconced in a cloud of ambiguity, lacking substantial corroboration and perhaps more emblematic of the mystique surrounding this phase of his life than a factual recounting.

This segment of Fonck's biography, enveloped in the mists of history, invites a reflection on the broader sentiments prevalent in France during the tumultuous years of World War II. The inclination towards Marshal Pétain, observed amongst a segment of the French populace, including Fonck, should not be hastily interpreted as an alignment with collaborationist tenets or an endorsement of the occupant's ideology. Rather, it underscores a complex socio-political dynamic where Pétain's aura, forged in the crucible of World War I, continued to evoke a semblance of trust and stability amidst the upheavals and uncertainties of the era. This nuanced perspective affords a deeper understanding of the varied motivations and allegiances that characterized the French experience under occupation, transcending simplistic categorizations to appreciate the intricate tapestry of individual and collective responses to the exigencies of wartime.
