AFD Tree

Installation:
There is no installation procedure. Simply copy
AFDTREE.EXE and AFDTREE.TXT into a folder of your
choice.

This program shows the contents of AFD BGL-files
in the form of an hierachical tree. This is similar
to the style of Windows Explorer.

AFD stands for Aircraft Facility Directory. This
data section was added to the BGL file format
when FS98 and CFS came out. Normaly files containing
AFD data will have "AFD" somewhere in the filename.
But it is possible that normal scenery BGL's will
also contain AFD data. AfdTree will show you an
error window if you try to open an BGL without
such data section. This little tool lets you have a
look into these files.

Normally you can expect that AFD BGL files will only
contain airport data or NDB/VOR data. Also every
new created BGL with AFD data will cause FS to
rebuild its internal data base.

The output window is a normal Windows Edit Control. This
means that you can use keybord commands CTRL-C and CTRL-V
to copy text to and from the clipboard.

Remark: If you don't see a button (+ or -) attached to a
node icon, the node cannot be axpanded. This happens
when a NameList is empty or when no following node exists.
Also the right window remains empty if there is no data
linked to a node.

Known problems:
* Sometimes this program confuses the option flags.
* In FS2K AFD files the runway headings often do not
match exactly with the ILS headings as they normally do
in FS98. If this happens AFDTREE will show you the
difference at the end of the line.
