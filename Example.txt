Example Multi-Layout Scenery Source

Isle of Arran

In the "Arran" folder you will find 28 terrain files which fit
together to make an elevated mesh scenery of the Isle of Arran
just off the Scottish coast.

The layouts are organised to fit together in the following fashion
to give a total size of about 40 km by 70 km

Load the terrain files into CfsTmap then "Create Bgl" for each of
them into the same folder.

Also included is a dos batch file (Linkit.bat) that demonstrates
how to use sclink to link multiple BGL files into a single BGL
when a suitable naming convention is used
