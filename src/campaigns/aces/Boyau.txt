Boyau, Maurice
France

   Maurice Jean-Paul Boyau was born in Mustapha, Algeria May 8, 1888. He was an international sports star, and at the start of hostilities was the Captain of France's International Rugby team.   
  Pre-war he served in the infantry, but his initial war service was with the 18th Army Service Corps as a driver. After repeated requests, Boyau managed to obtain a transfer to the Flying Service; after completing his training, he received his Pilot's Brevet on November 28, 1915.
 Boyau served as a flight instructor at Buc, then transferred to Esc N.77 which was forming up at the end of September 1916.
  For the next year and a half, Boyau flew Nieuports and then SPADs with Esc 77.  He specialized in downing observation balloons, and quickly became an ace at this extremely dangerous occupation. 
  On September 16, 1918, Boyau destroyed yet another balloon, his thirty fifth victory of the war. On his zoom away from his blazing victim his SPAD was hit by ground fire and set ablaze in turn. His aircraft staggered and crashed into the ground, killing Boyau instantly. A statue and stadium in his name honour his memory in Dax, Aquitaine.
